1.  Introduction

   The IETF began standardization work on interoperable Instant
   Messaging in the late 1990s, but since that period, the typical
   feature set of these systems has expanded widely and was largely
   driven by the industry without much standardization or
   interoperability.  The More Instant Messaging Interop (MIMI) Working
   Group (see [I-D.ietf-mimi-arch]) was chartered to develop protocols
   for IM interoperability using end-to-end encryption with the MLS
   protocol [RFC9420] and architecture ([RFC9750]).

   The largest and most widely deployed Instant Messaging (IM) systems
   support end-to-end message encryption using a variant of the Double
   Ratchet protocol [DoubleRatchet] popularized by Signal and the
   companion X3DH [X3DH] key agreement protocol.  Many vendors have also
   implemented MLS for IM.  These protocols provide confidentiality of
   sessions (with Double Ratchet) and groups (with MLS) once the
   participants in a conversation have been identified.  However, the
   current state of most systems require the end user to manually verify
   key fingerprints or blindly trust their instant messaging service not
   to add and remove participants from their conversations.  This
   problem is exacerbated when these systems federate or try to
   interoperate.  Even systems that have some type of Key Transparency
   [I-D.ietf-keytrans-architecture] are essentially Trust On First Use
   (TOFU).

   While some single vendor solutions exist, clearly an interoperable
   mechanism for IM identity is needed.  This document builds on the
   roles described in [I-D.barnes-mimi-identity-arch].  First this
   document attempts to articulate a clear description and semantics of
   different identifiers used in IM systems.  Next the document provides
   an example of how to represent those identifiers in a common way.
   Then the document discusses different trust approaches.  Finally the
   document surveys various cryptographic methods of making and
   verifying assertions about these identifiers.

   Arguably, as with email, the success of XMPP [RFC6120] was partially
   due to the ease of communicating among XMPP users in different
   domains with different XMPP servers, and a single standardized
   address format for all XMPP users.

   The goal of this document is to explore the problem space, so that
   the IETF community can write a consensus requirements document and
   framework.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Types of Identifiers

   IM systems have a number of types of identifiers.  Few (or perhaps
   no) systems use every type of identifier described here.  Not every
   configuration of the same application necessarily use the same list
   of identifiers.

   Domain identifier:  A bare domain name is often used for discovery of
      a specific IM service such as example.com or im.example.com.  Many
      proprietary IM systems operate in a single domain and have no
      concept of domains or federation.

   Handle identifier:  A handle is an identifier which represents a user
      or service.  A handle is usually intended for external sharing
      (for example it could appear on or in a paper or electronic
      business card).  IM systems could have handles which are unscoped
      (don't contain a domain) or scoped (contain a domain).  Unscoped
      handles are often prefixed with a commercial at-sign ("@").
      Handles in some services are mutable.  For example, @alice_smith
      could become @alice_jones or @alex_smith after change of marital
      status or gender transition.

                                 Table 1

   Table: some Handle identifier styles

   User or account identifier:  Many systems have an internal
      representation of a user, service, or account separate from the
      handle.  This is especially useful when the handle is allowed to
      change.  Unlike the handle, this identifier typically cannot
      change.  For example the user identifier could be a UUID or a
      similar construction.  In IRC, a user identifier is prefixed with
      a "!" character (example: !jcapulet1583@example.com for the "nick"
      @juliet).

   Client or Device identifier:  Most commercial instant messaging
      systems allow a single user to have multiple devices at the same
      time, for example a desktop computer and a phone.  Usually, each
      client instance of the user is represented with a separate
      identifier with separate keys.  Typically these identifiers are
      internal and not visible to the end-user (XMPP fully qualified
      JIDs are a rare exception).  The client or device identifier is
      often based on a UUID, a persistent long-term unique identifier
      like an IMEI or MAC address, a sequence number assigned by the IM
      service domain, or a combination.  In some cases the identifier
      may contain the internal user identifier.  These identifiers look
      quite different across protocols and vendors.

                                  Table 2

   Table: some Client/Device identifier styles.

   Group Chat or Channel identifier (external):  All or nearly all
      instant messaging systems have the concept of named groups or
      channels which support more than 2 members and whose membership
      can change over time.  Many IM systems support an external
      identifier for these groups and allows them to be addressed.  In
      IRC and many other systems, they are identified with a "#" (hash-
      mark) prefix.  The proliferation of hashtags on social media makes
      this convention less common on newer systems.

   Group, Conversation, or Session identifiers (internal):  Most IM
      protocols use an internal representation for a group or 1:1 chat.
      In MLS this is called the group_id.  The Wire protocol uses the
      term qualified conversation ID to refer to a group internally
      across domains.  Among implementations of the Double Ratchet
      family of protocols a unidirectional sequence of messages from one
      client to another is referred to as a session, and often has an
      associated session identifier.

   Team or Workspace identifier:  A less common type of identifier among
      IM systems is used to describe a set of users or accounts.  This
      is described variously as a team, workspace, or tenant.

   One user often has multiple clients (for example a mobile and a
   desktop client).  A handle usually refers to a single user or rarely
   it may redirect to multiple users.  In some systems, the user
   identifier is a handle.  In other systems the user identifier is an
   internal representation, for example a UUID.  Handles may be changed/
   renamed, but hopefully internal user identifiers do not.  Likewise,
   group conversation identifiers could be internal or external
   representations, whereas group names or channel names are often
   external friendly representations.

   It is easy to imagine a loose hierarchy between these identifiers
   (domain to user to device), but hard to agree on a specific fixed
   structure.  In some systems, the group chat or session itself has a
   position in the hierarchy underneath the domain, the user, or the
   device.

   As described in the next section, the author proposes using URIs as a
   container for interoperable IM identifiers.  All the examples use the
   mimi: URI scheme described in [I-D.ietf-mimi-protocol].  While other
   URI schemes could be used inside IM systems, the distinction between
   each type of identifier is implicit rather than explicit.  Other
   schemes are fine within a closed system, as long as the comparison
   and validation rules are clear.

4.  Representation of identifiers using URIs

   Most if not all of the identifiers described in the previous section
   could be represented as URIs.  While individual instant messaging
   protocol-specific URI schemes may not have been specified with this
   use of URIs in mind, the mimi: URI scheme is flexible enough to
   represent all of or any needed subset of the previously discussed
   identifiers.

   For example, the XMPP protocol can represent a domain, a handle (bare
   JID), or a device (fully qualified JID).  Unfortunately its xmpp: URI
   scheme was only designed to represent handles and domains, but the
   mimi: URI scheme can represent all XMPP identifiers:

   *  mimi://example.com (domain only)

   *  mimi://example.com/u/juliet (bare JID - handle)

   *  mimi://example.com/d/juliet/balcony (fully qualified JID - client/
      device)

   Likewise the IRC protocol can represent domain, handle (nick), user
   (account), and channel.  The examples below represent a domain, a
   nick, a user, a local channel, and the projectX channel.

   *  mimi://irc.example.com

   *  mimi://irc.example.com/u/juliet

   *  mimi://irc.example.com/u/jcapulet1583@example.com

   *  mimi://irc.example.com/r/local_announcements_channel

   *  mimi://irc.example.com/r/projectX

   The first path segment in a MIMI URI discriminates the type of
   identifier and makes the type of resource unambiguous

                   Table 3: types of MIMI URI identifiers

   A Pseudonym is a user identifier that is designed to conceal the
   identity of its user, but may or may not wish to reveal its
   pseudonymous nature.  In that way a pseudonym could be represented
   with a first path segment as a User or as Pseudonym, according to
   local policy.

      Note that if there is no domain, a URI scheme could use
      local.invalid in place of a resolvable domain name.

   mimi://local.invalid/u/alice.smith

5.  Different Root of Trust Approaches

   Different IM applications and different users of these applications
   may have different trust needs.  The following subsections describe
   three specific trust models for example purposes.  Note that the
   descriptions in this section use certificates in their examples, but
   nothing in this section should preclude using a different technology
   which provides similar assertions.

5.1.  Centralized credential hierarchy

   In this environment, end-user devices trust a centralized authority
   operating on behalf of their domain (for example, a Certificate
   Authority), that is trusted by all the other clients in that domain
   (and can be trusted by federated domains).  The centralized authority
   could easily be associated with a traditional Identity Provider
   (IdP).  This is a popular trust model for companies running services
   for their own employees and contractors.  This is also popular with
   governments providing services to their employees and contractors or
   to residents or citizens for whom they provide services.

   For example XYZ Corporation could make an assertion that "I represent
   XYZ Corporation and this user demonstrated she is Alice Smith of the
   Engineering department of XYZ Corporation."

   In this model, a Certificate Authority (CA) run by or on behalf of
   the domain generates certificates for one or more of the identifier
   types described previously.  The specifics of the assertions are very
   important for interoperability.  Even within this centralized
   credential hierarchy model, there are at least three ways to make
   assertions about different types of IM identifiers with certificates:

   Example 1 (Separate Certs):  The CA generates one certificate for a
      user Alice which is used to sign Alice's profile.  The CA also
      generates a separate certificate for Alice's desktop client and a
      third for her phone client.  The private key in each client
      certificate is used to sign MLS KeyPackages or Double Ratchet-
      style prekeys.

   Example 2 (Single Combined Cert):  The CA generates a single
      certificate per client which covers both Alice's handle and her
      client identifier in the same certificate.  The private key in
      each of these certificates is used to sign MLS KeyPackages or
      Double Ratchet-style prekeys.  Note that there is no separate key
      pair used to refer to the user distinct from a device.  All the
      legitimate device key pairs would be able to sign on behalf of the
      user.

   Example 3 (Cascading Certs):  The CA generates a single user
      certificate for Alice's handle and indicates that the user
      certificate can issue its own certificates.  The user certificate
      then generates one certificate for Alice's desktop client and
      another certificate for Alice's phone client.  The private key in
      each client certificate is used to sign MLS KeyPackages or Double
      Ratchet-style prekeys.

   What is important in all these examples is that other clients
   involved in a session or group chat can validate the relevant
   credentials of the other participants in the session or group chat.
   Clients would need to be able to configure the relevant trust roots
   and walk any hierarchy unambiguously.

   When using certificates, this could include associating an Issuer URI
   in the issuerAltName with one of the URIs in the subjectAltName of
   another cert.  Other mechanisms have analogous concepts.

   Regardless of the specific implementation, this model features a
   strong hierarchy.

   The advantage of this approach is to take advantage of a strong
   hierarchy which is already in use at an organization, especially if
   the organization is using an Identity Provider (IdP) for most of its
   services.  Even if the IM system is compromised, the presence of
   client without the correct end-to-end identity would be detected
   immediately.

   The disadvantage of this approach is that if the CA colludes with a
   malicious IM system or both are compromised, an attacker or malicious
   IM system can easily insert a rogue client which would be as trusted
   as a legitimate client.

5.2.  Web of Trust

   In some communities, it may be appropriate to make assertions about
   IM identity by relying on a web of trust.  The following specific
   example of this general method is used by the OMEMO community
   presented by [Schaub] and proposed in [Matrix1756].  This document
   does not take any position on the specifics of the proposal, but uses
   it to illustrate a concrete implementation of a web of trust
   involving IM identifiers.

   The example uses a web of trust with cross signing as follows:

   *  Each user (Alice and Bob) has a master key.

   *  Alice's master key signs exactly two keys:

      -  Alice's device-signing key (which then signs her own device
         keys), and

      -  Alice's user-signing key (which can sign the master key of
         other users).

   The advantage of this approach is that if Alice's and Bob's keys,
   implementations, and devices are not compromised, there is no way the
   infrastructure can forge a key for Alice or Bob and insert an
   eavesdropper or active attacker.  The disadvantages of this approach
   are that this requires Alice's device-signing key to be available any
   time Alice wants to add a new device, and Alice's user-signing key to
   be available anytime she wants to add a new user to her web of trust.
   This could either make those operations inconvenient and/or
   unnecessarily expose either or both of those keys.

             Alice          :          Bob
           +--------+       :       +--------+
           | master |<---\  /------>| master |
           +--------+     \/:       +--------+
            /    \       / \___      /     \
           /      \     /   :  \    /       \
   +---------+  +---------+  +---------+  +---------+
   | device  |  |  user   | :|  user   |  | device  |
   | signing |  | signing | :| signing |  | signing |
   +---------+  +---------+ :+---------+  +---------+
      /     \               :              /     \
   +----+  +----+           :          +----+  +----+
   | A1 |  | A2 |           :          | B1 |  | B2 |
   +----+  +----+           :          +----+  +----+

   Figure: Alice and Bob cross sign each other's master keys

   A detailed architecture for Web of Trust key infrastructure which is
   not specific to Instant Messaging systems is the Mathematical Mesh
   [I-D.hallambaker-mesh-architecture].

5.3.  Well-known service cross signing

   In this trust model, a user with several services places a cross
   signature for all their services at a well known location on each of
   those services (for example a personal web site .well-known page, an
   IM profile, the profile page on an open source code repository, a
   social media About page, a picture sharing service profile page, a
   professional interpersonal-networking site contact page, and a dating
   application profile).  This concept was perhaps first implemented for
   non-technical users by Keybase.  The user of this scheme likely
   expects that at any given moment there is a risk that one of these
   services is compromised or controlled by a malicious entity, but
   expects the likelihood of all or most of their services being
   compromised simultaneously is very low.

   The advantage of this approach is that it does not rely on anyone but
   the user herself.  This disadvantage is that if an attacker is able
   to delete or forge cross signatures on a substantial number of the
   services, the forged assertions would looks as legitimate as the
   authentic assertions (or more convincing).

5.4.  Combining approaches

   These different trust approaches could be combined, however the
   verification rules become more complicated.  Among other problems,
   implementers need to decide what happens if two different trust
   methods come to incompatible conclusions.  For example, what should
   the application do if web of trust certificates indicate that a
   client or user should be trusted, but a centralized hierarchy
   indicates a client should not be, or vice versa.

6.  Cryptographic mechanisms to make assertions about IM identifiers

6.1.  X.509 Certificates

   X.509 certificates are a mature technology for making assertions
   about identifiers.  The supported assertions and identifier formats
   used in certificates are somewhat archaic, inflexible, and pedantic,
   but well understood.  The semantics are always that an Issuer asserts
   that a Subject has control of a specific public key key pair.  A
   handful of additional attributes can be added as X.509 certificate
   extensions, although adding new extensions is laborious and time
   consuming.  In practice new extensions are only added to facilitate
   the internals of managing the lifetime, validity, and applicability
   of certificates.  X.509 extensions are not appropriate for arbitrary
   assertions or claims about the Subject.

   The Subject field contains a Distinguished Name, whose Common Name
   (CN) field can contain free form text.  The subjectAltName can
   contain multiple other identifiers for the Subject with types such as
   a URI, email address, DNS domain names, or Distinguished Name.  The
   rules about which combinations of extensions are valid are defined in
   the Internet certificate profile described in [RFC5280].  As noted in
   a previous section of this document, URIs are a natural container for
   holding instant messaging identifiers.  Implementations need to be
   careful to insure that the correct semantics are applied to a URI, as
   they may be referring to different objects (ex: a handle versus a
   client identifier).  There is a corresponding issuerAltName field as
   well.

   Certificates are already supported in MLS as a standard credential
   type which can be included in MLS LeafNodes and KeyPackages.

      In the X3DH key agreement protocol (used with Double Ratchet), the
      first message in a session between a pair of clients can contain
      an optional certificate, but this is not standardized.

   Arguably the biggest drawback to using X.509 certificates is that
   administratively it can be difficult to obtain certificates for
   entities that can also generate certificates---specifically to issue
   a certificate with the standard extension basicContraints=CA:TRUE.

6.2.  JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and CBOR Web Tokens (CWT)

   JSON Web Signing (JWS) [RFC7515] and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) [RFC7519]
   are toolkits for making a variety of cryptographic claims.  (CBOR Web
   Tokens [RFC8392] are semantically equivalent to JSON Web Tokens.)
   Both token types are an appealing option for carrying IM identifiers
   and assertions, as the container type is flexible and the format is
   easy to implement.  Unfortunately the semantics for validating
   identifiers are not as rigorously specified as for certificates at
   the time of this writing, and require additional specification work.

   The JWT Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) specification
   [RFC9449] adds the ability to make claims which involve proof of
   possession of a (typically private) key, and to share those claims
   with third parties.  The owner of a the key generates a proof which
   is used to fetch an access token which can then be verified by a
   third party.  JWT DPoP was actually created as an improvement over
   Bearer tokens used for authentication, so its use as a certificate-
   like assertion may require substantial clarification and possibly
   additional profile work.

   While there is support for token introspection, in general access
   tokens need online verification between resources and the token
   issuer.

   }

   to an IM URI

   Finally, there are selective disclosure variants of JWTs
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] and CWTs
   [I-D.ietf-spice-sd-cwt] available.  Selective Disclosure JWTs (SD-
   JWT) have an optional key binding mechanism.  Selective Disclosure
   CWTs (SD-CWT) have a mandatory Key Binding Token (KBT).  Both can be
   used directly as MLS credentials [I-D.mahy-mls-sd-cwt-credential].

6.3.  Verifiable Credentials

   Verifiable Credentials (VC) is a framework for exchanging machine-
   readable credentials [W3C.REC-vc-data-model-20191119].  The framework
   is well specified and has a very flexbile assertion structure, which
   in addition to or in place of basic names and identifiers, can
   optionally include arbitrary attributes (ex: security clearance, age,
   nationality) up to and including selective disclosure depending on
   the profile being used.  For example, a verifiable credential could
   be used to assert that an IM client belongs to a Customer Support
   agent of Sirius Cybernetic Corp, who speaks English and Vogon, and is
   qualified to give support for their Ident-I-Eeze product, without
   revealing the name of the agent.

   The VC specification describes both Verifiable Credentials and
   Verifiable Presentations.  A Verifiable Credential contains
   assertions made by an issuer.  Holders assemble credentials into a
   Verifiable Presentation.  Verifiers can validate the Verifiable
   Credentials in the Verifiable Presentation.  Specific credential
   types are defined by referencing ontologies.  The example at the end
   of this section uses the VCard ontology [W3C.WD-vcard-rdf-20130924].

   Most of the examples for Verifiable Credentials and many of the
   implementations by commercial identity providers use Decentralized
   Identifiers (DIDs), but there is no requirement to use DID or the
   associated esoteric cryptography in a specific VC profile.  (Indeed
   the VC profile for COVID-19 for vaccination does not use DIDs).  The
   most significant problem with VCs are that there is no off-the-shelf
   mechanism for proof of possession of a private key, and no consensus
   to use VCs for user authentication (as opposed to using VCs to assert
   identity attributes).

   While the examples in this document are represented as JSON,
   including whitespace, the actual JSON encoding used for VC has no
   whitespace.

   The first example shows a fragment of the claims in a JWT-based VC
   proof, referencing the VCard ontology.

   Figure: fragment of example VC claims using VCard ontology

   In the next example, there is a Verifiable Presentation (VP) JOSE
   header and claims which contains two embedded VCs for the same
   holder.  The JOSE header contains an actual Ed25519 public key.  The
   corresponding key id could be expressed using the kid type with a
   urn:ietf:params:oauth:jwk-thumbprint:sha-256: prefix, the actual
   fingerprint value would be
   mJafqNxZWNAIkaDGPlNyhccFSAqnRjhyA3FJNm0f8I8.

   The first VC contains a full name and a handle-style identifier.  It
   is created by one issuer (for example an identity provider), and uses
   standard claims from OpenID Connect Core.  The second VC contains a
   client or device identifier and is created by a different issuer (the
   IM service).

   Note that in the text version of this document, the jws values and
   verification Method URLs are truncated.

6.4.  Other possible mechanisms

   Below are other mechanisms which were not investigated due to a lack
   of time.

   *  Anonymous credential schemes which can present attributes without
      the long-term identity (ex: travel agent for specific team) such
      as those generated by the Privacy Pass Architecture [RFC9576], or
      Anonymous Credit Tokens [I-D.draft-schlesinger-cfrg-act]. .- Zero-
      knowledge proofs - new work is starting in the IETF to define JSON
      Web Proofs (JWP) [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-proof], a new format that
      uses zero knowledge proofs (with both JSON and CBOR formats).

   *  Deniable credentials
